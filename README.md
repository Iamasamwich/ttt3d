## Summary

A 3 dimensional Tic Tac Toe game that tallies score between X and O players.

Like traditional Tic Tac Toe, but played with 3 boards stacked on top of each other.

Where Tic Tac Toe has 8 winning combinations, being able to choose across 3 layers means that there are 49 winning combinations:

* 27 in straight lines (horizontal, vertial, down through the layers)
* 10 diagonals (2 on each layer, 4 going through all layers)
* 12 diagonals through the layers while staying horizontal or vertical)
